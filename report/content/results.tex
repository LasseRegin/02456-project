\section{Results}

We expect that it would be possible to predict the correct area of the
frame where the ball is positionen, given the frame and possibly the
previous frames in time.

The best case would be that we will be able to predict the exact
position of the ball on a pixel level, and that we will generalize
to unseen observations.

The worst case would be that our model will predict the position of the
ball at random.
