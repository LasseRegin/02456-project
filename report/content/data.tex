\section{Datasets}

The dataset used in this project is provided by \texttt{Sportcaster}
and contains a number of video samples from Ultra HD recordings of
different football matches. Each frame has an associated data
dictionary, containing information about the position of the ball in
the frame - if the ball is visible.

I.e. our dataset contains frames of dimension $3840 \times 2160$ with,
and with out a ball and it's corresponding position coordinates.
