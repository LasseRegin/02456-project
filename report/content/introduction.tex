\section{Introduction}
You are watching your favourite team play a football match. The camera
is zooming in around the action packed area of the ball, which intensifies the experience.
This scenario is in reality handled by a lots of camera men
following the ball with their cameras. This is a costly process and
prawn to human errors. What if it was possible to have the camera
zoom in automatically on the area of action with perfection and
no delay. This is essentially what this project can lead to among
other things as we try to make a deep learning network that can learn to
track the position of the ball in the video frames.
