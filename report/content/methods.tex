\section{Methods}
Our input will be annotated video frames and the target will be a one-hot encoded vector containing the position of the ball.

We will start out by making a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn features from the frames.
Later we will attempt to use Google's \textit{Inception} network \cite{inception}.

Furthermore, we want to implement a more advanced model taking the temporal information between the frames into account in a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This will be combined with a CNN learning the ball features.
