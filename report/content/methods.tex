\section{Methods}
Our input will be annotated video frames and the output will be a boolean cell list with TRUE in the cell where the ball is placed and FALSE elsewhere.

We will start out making a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn features from the frames.

Furthermore, we want to implement a more advanced model taking the temporal information between the frames into account in a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This will be combined with a CNN learning the ball features.
